# Derpy Mod 

# Introduction
This is a Hypixel Skyblock Chattriggers Module, which aims to make ping glide more consistent.

# Features
  - Ping Glide
    - Ping glide is a technique in mining where you move your cursor to the next block right before you break the previous one. This eliminates any delay between the block that is just broken and the next block that you are going to mine. This can be quite difficult to master and get consistent with, especially if you have high ping. This feature visually indicates when to switch between blocks, making it easier to become consistent when performing the technique.


# Installation
  - To install the mod, you will need to download the zip file and take out the DerpyMod folder. Then, put that folder inside your modules folder, which is inside the chattriggers folder. If done properly, you should be able to load chattriggers and type /derpymod to open the GUI.
